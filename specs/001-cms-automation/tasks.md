# Tasks: AI-Powered CMS Automation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-cms-automation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-spec.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not explicitly requested in the feature specification. This task list focuses on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md, this project uses web application structure:
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`, `backend/migrations/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Phase 1: All models for US1 can start together:
Task T039: "Create TopicRequest model in backend/src/models/topic_request.py"
Task T040: "Create Article model with status enum in backend/src/models/article.py"
Task T041: "Create TopicEmbedding model for similarity detection in backend/src/models/topic_embedding.py"

# Phase 2: Generator components (after models complete):
Task T044: "Implement Claude API client wrapper in backend/src/services/article_generator/claude_client.py"
Task T045: "Create article generation prompts in backend/src/services/article_generator/prompts.py"
Task T048: "Implement cost tracking in backend/src/services/article_generator/cost_tracker.py"

# Phase 3: API schemas can start in parallel:
Task T056: "Create TopicRequest schemas in backend/src/api/schemas/topic_request.py"
Task T057: "Create Article schemas in backend/src/api/schemas/article.py"

# Phase 4: Frontend components can start together:
Task T065: "Create TopicSubmissionForm component in frontend/src/components/ArticleGenerator/TopicSubmissionForm.tsx"
Task T066: "Create GenerationProgress component in frontend/src/components/ArticleGenerator/GenerationProgress.tsx"
Task T067: "Create ArticlePreview component in frontend/src/components/ArticleGenerator/ArticlePreview.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - RECOMMENDED

1. ‚úÖ Complete **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T011)
2. ‚úÖ Complete **Phase 2: Foundational** (T012-T038) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. ‚úÖ Complete **Phase 3: User Story 1** (T039-T076) - MVP READY
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Submit article topics through UI
   - Verify articles generated within 5 minutes
   - Test batch submissions
   - Verify duplicate detection works
   - Confirm all 3 acceptance scenarios pass
5. Deploy/demo if ready - **THIS IS YOUR MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT**

**MVP Scope**: 76 tasks for complete article generation workflow

### Incremental Delivery (Add Stories Sequentially)

1. Foundation + User Story 1 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (MVP with article generation)
2. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (MVP + automated tagging)
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (Full automation with scheduling)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (Complete with review workflow)
5. Polish Phase ‚Üí Production-ready

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T038)
2. **Once Foundational is done, parallel development**:
   - **Developer Team A**: User Story 1 (T039-T076) - Article Generation
   - **Developer Team B**: User Story 2 (T077-T106) - Tagging System
   - **Developer Team C**: User Story 3 (T107-T137) - Scheduling System
   - **Developer Team D**: User Story 4 (T138-T166) - Review Workflow
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Polish phase after all stories complete

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 11 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 27 tasks - BLOCKING ALL STORIES
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1 - MVP)**: 38 tasks
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: 30 tasks
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: 31 tasks
- **Phase 6 (User Story 4)**: 30 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 30 tasks

**Total**: 197 tasks

**MVP Scope** (Setup + Foundational + US1): 76 tasks
**Full Feature** (All User Stories): 167 tasks
**Production Ready** (Full + Polish): 197 tasks

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story is independently testable**: Can validate each story works without others
- **MVP strategy**: Complete just User Story 1 for fastest time-to-value
- **Incremental delivery**: Add one story at a time, test, deploy
- **Parallel execution**: Once Foundational is done, all user stories can proceed simultaneously
- **File paths**: All paths specified for immediate implementation
- **No tests included**: Tests not explicitly requested in specification, focus on implementation

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow required format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
