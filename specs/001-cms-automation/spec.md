# Feature Specification: AI-Powered CMS Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-cms-automation`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement AI-powered CMS automation using Claude Computer Use API to automatically create, format, tag, and schedule article posts."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Article Creation (Priority: P1)

Content managers can provide article topics or outlines and receive fully formatted, ready-to-publish articles without manual content creation.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - automating the most time-consuming part of content management. Without this, the feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting an article topic and verifying a complete article is generated with proper formatting and delivers immediate time savings for content creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content manager is logged into the CMS, **When** they submit an article topic through the automation interface, **Then** a complete article with title, body, and formatting is generated within 5 minutes for 95% of requests
2. **Given** an article outline is provided with specific sections, **When** the automation processes the request, **Then** the generated article follows the outlined structure exactly
3. **Given** multiple article topics are submitted simultaneously, **When** the automation processes the batch, **Then** all articles are generated without conflicts or data corruption

### User Story 2 - Intelligent Tagging and Categorization (Priority: P2)

Articles are automatically tagged and categorized based on content analysis, ensuring consistent taxonomy and improving content discoverability.

**Why this priority**: Tagging is essential for content organization and SEO, but manual tagging is inconsistent and time-consuming. This provides immediate organizational value once articles can be created.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by providing pre-written articles to the tagging system and verifying appropriate tags and categories are assigned based on content analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a generated article about a specific topic, **When** the tagging system analyzes the content, **Then** relevant tags are automatically assigned with at least 85% accuracy compared to manual tagging by qualified content editors (baseline: editors with 6+ months CMS experience)
2. **Given** an article covering multiple topics, **When** categorization runs, **Then** the article is assigned to all relevant categories without duplicates
3. **Given** existing tags in the CMS taxonomy, **When** new articles are processed, **Then** the system uses existing tags when appropriate rather than creating synonyms

---

### User Story 3 - Scheduling and Publishing Workflow (Priority: P3)

Content managers can define publishing schedules and the system automatically publishes articles at specified times without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Scheduling automation saves time and ensures consistent publishing cadence, but articles must exist first (depends on P1) and be properly organized (enhanced by P2).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by scheduling pre-created articles for future publication and verifying they publish at the correct time with proper status transitions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed article ready for publication, **When** a content manager sets a future publication date and time, **Then** the article automatically publishes at the specified time within 1-minute accuracy
2. **Given** multiple articles scheduled for the same time slot, **When** the publication time arrives, **Then** all articles publish successfully without system overload
3. **Given** a scheduled article with dependencies (e.g., featured images), **When** publication time arrives but dependencies are missing, **Then** the system notifies the content manager and holds the article in draft status

---

### User Story 4 - Content Review and Approval (Priority: P4)

Content managers can review AI-generated content before publication and request modifications or approve for immediate or scheduled publishing.

**Why this priority**: Quality control is important but not required for MVP - automated publishing can work without review for trusted content types. This adds safety and quality assurance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by generating articles, placing them in review status, and testing approval/rejection workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AI-generated article in review status, **When** a content manager reviews and approves it, **Then** the article moves to publishable status and can be published immediately or scheduled
2. **Given** an article requiring modifications, **When** a reviewer provides specific feedback, **Then** the system re-processes the article incorporating the feedback
3. **Given** multiple reviewers with different permission levels, **When** they attempt to approve articles, **Then** only authorized reviewers can approve articles for publication

### Edge Cases

**MVP Scope (Covered by Tasks)**:
- What happens when the Claude API is temporarily unavailable during article generation? → Handled by retry logic with exponential backoff (T054)

**Post-MVP / Phase 4+ Enhancements**:
- How does the system handle duplicate article topics submitted by different users? → Semantic similarity detection alerts users before generation (FR-018, deferred to Phase 4)
- What occurs when scheduled publication time conflicts with CMS maintenance windows? → Future: Add maintenance window awareness to scheduling service
- How does the system manage articles that exceed platform content length limits? → Future: Add CMS-specific validation before article creation
- What happens when tagging confidence is below acceptable thresholds? → Future: Flag for manual review when confidence < 70%
- How does the system handle special characters or non-English content in article generation? → Future: Multi-language support and character encoding validation
- What occurs when a scheduled article is manually deleted before its publication time? → Future: Add schedule cleanup job to detect orphaned schedules

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
