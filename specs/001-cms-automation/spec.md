## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Article Import & Content Management (Priority: P0)

**As a** content manager
**I want to** batch import existing articles (from external writers, archives, or other sources)
**So that** I can feed them into the SEO optimization and publishing pipeline

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for the entire system. Without article import, there is no content to optimize or publish. This is the foundational capability that enables all downstream features.

**Independent Test**: Upload a CSV file containing 100 articles with various formats (HTML, Markdown, plain text) and verify all are correctly imported, validated, and stored with proper data integrity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content manager has a CSV file with 100 existing articles
   **When** they upload the file through the import API/interface
   **Then** all 100 articles are imported within 5 minutes with:
   - Validation of required fields (title, content)
   - HTML sanitization (prevent XSS)
   - Image URL extraction and validation
   - Status set to `imported`
   - Source tracking metadata

2. **Given** an article contains 5 image URLs
   **When** the import process runs
   **Then** all image references are:
   - Validated for accessibility
   - Stored in `article_metadata.images` JSONB field
   - Downloaded to local storage (optional)
   - Ready for Computer Use upload

3. **Given** imported content contains malicious HTML (`<script>` tags, `onclick` attributes)
   **When** the sanitization process runs
   **Then** all dangerous HTML is stripped while preserving safe formatting (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images)

4. **Given** a manually entered article (via UI form)
   **When** submitted
   **Then** the article is validated, saved to database, and status set to `imported`

5. **Given** duplicate detection is enabled
   **When** importing an article with 85%+ title similarity to an existing one
   **Then** the system displays a warning and requires user confirmation before proceeding

**Dependencies**: None (foundational feature)

### User Story 2 - Intelligent SEO Analysis & Metadata Generation (Priority: P0)

**As a** content manager
**I want to** automatically analyze articles and generate SEO-optimized metadata
**So that** my articles rank higher in search engines without manual SEO work

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the system. SEO optimization directly impacts search visibility, organic traffic, and business outcomes. This must work reliably before publishing.

**Independent Test**: Analyze 20 test articles and compare generated SEO metadata against expert-written benchmarks. Verify 85%+ keyword accuracy and proper character length constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an imported article with 1500 words
   **When** SEO analysis is triggered (via API or UI)
   **Then** within 30 seconds the system generates:
   - SEO Title: 50-60 characters, includes focus keyword
   - Meta Description: 150-160 characters, compelling call-to-action
   - Focus Keyword: 1 primary keyword (highest relevance)
   - Primary Keywords: 3-5 semantically related keywords
   - Secondary Keywords: 5-10 long-tail variations
   - Keyword Density: JSONB map of {keyword: percentage}
   - Readability Score: Flesch-Kincaid grade level (target: 8-10)
   - Optimization Recommendations: Array of actionable suggestions

2. **Given** 20 test articles analyzed by the system
   **When** compared to SEO metadata written by qualified SEO experts
   **Then** the system achieves:
   - 85%+ accuracy on keyword extraction
   - 90%+ compliance with character length limits
   - 80%+ relevance score for generated meta descriptions

3. **Given** a generated SEO title is 70 characters (exceeds limit)
   **When** validation runs
   **Then** the system:
   - Automatically truncates to 60 characters at word boundary
   - Adds warning to `optimization_recommendations`
   - Logs the issue for review

4. **Given** SEO analysis completes successfully
   **When** results are saved
   **Then** all metadata is stored in `seo_metadata` table with:
   - Foreign key to `articles.id`
   - Generation timestamp
   - Claude API cost tracking
   - Token usage metrics

5. **Given** a content manager reviews auto-generated SEO metadata
   **When** they manually edit the SEO title or description
   **Then** changes are:
   - Saved to `seo_metadata` table
   - Tracked in `manual_overrides` JSONB field with timestamp
   - Used in final publishing (overrides AI-generated values)

**Dependencies**: User Story 1 (requires articles to analyze)

### User Story 3 - Multi-Provider Computer Use Publishing (Priority: P0)

**As a** content manager
**I want to** publish articles to WordPress using flexible automation providers (Anthropic/Gemini/Playwright)
**So that** I can choose the best balance of cost, reliability, and adaptability for my use case

**Why this priority**: This is the core technical innovation. Multi-provider architecture ensures we're not locked into a single vendor and can optimize for cost/performance based on testing results.

**Independent Test**: Execute full publishing workflow using each provider (Anthropic, Gemini, Playwright) on test WordPress instance. Verify all steps complete successfully with screenshot evidence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an article with SEO metadata ready for publishing
   **And** the system is configured to use Anthropic Computer Use provider
   **When** a publish task is submitted
   **Then** within 5 minutes the system:
   - Opens Chrome browser (headless)
   - Navigates to WordPress admin panel
   - Logs in with provided credentials
   - Creates new post
   - Fills title and content
   - Uploads images (if any)
   - Configures Yoast SEO fields:
     - SEO Title (from `seo_metadata.meta_title`)
     - Meta Description (from `seo_metadata.meta_description`)
     - Focus Keyphrase (from `seo_metadata.focus_keyword`)
   - Sets categories and tags
   - Clicks "Publish" button
   - Verifies publication success
   - Extracts published article URL
   - Takes 8+ screenshots documenting each step

2. **Given** the system is configured to use Gemini Computer Use provider
   **When** the same publish task is executed
   **Then** the publishing workflow completes successfully using Gemini's Computer Use API with equivalent results

3. **Given** the system is configured to use Playwright provider (fallback)
   **When** the same publish task is executed
   **Then** the traditional browser automation completes successfully using pre-defined selectors

4. **Given** a Computer Use publish task fails (e.g., login error)
   **When** the failure is detected
   **Then** the system:
   - Marks task status as `failed`
   - Records error message in `publish_tasks.error_message`
   - Saves screenshot of failure state
   - Retries up to 3 times (configurable)
   - If still failing, notifies user via webhook/email

5. **Given** WordPress UI has changed (e.g., plugin update)
   **And** Playwright provider fails due to outdated selectors
   **When** automatic fallback is enabled
   **Then** the system:
   - Detects Playwright failure
   - Automatically retries with Anthropic provider (AI-adaptive)
   - Logs the fallback event for analysis

6. **Given** a publish task with 5 images
   **When** Computer Use executes image upload
   **Then** all 5 images are:
   - Uploaded to WordPress media library
   - Set as featured image (first image) or inserted inline (remaining)
   - Verified via screenshot

**Dependencies**: User Story 2 (requires SEO metadata)

---

### User Story 4 - Publishing Task Monitoring & Audit Trail (Priority: P1)

**As a** content manager
**I want to** monitor real-time publishing task status and review execution screenshots
**So that** I can verify quality, debug failures, and maintain compliance audit records

**Why this priority**: Observability is critical for production reliability. Screenshot audit trail provides accountability and debugging capability that's essential for Computer Use automation.

**Independent Test**: Submit 10 publishing tasks and verify task status API returns accurate real-time progress and all screenshots are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Computer Use publish task is running
   **When** the user queries task status via API
   **Then** the response includes:
   - Current status: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`
   - Current step description (e.g., "Uploading images...")
   - Progress percentage (based on step count)
   - Elapsed time (seconds)
   - Estimated remaining time

2. **Given** a publish task completes successfully
   **When** the user views task details
   **Then** the system displays:
   - 8+ screenshots in chronological order:
     - `login_success.png`
     - `editor_loaded.png`
     - `content_filled.png`
     - `images_uploaded.png`
     - `seo_fields_filled.png`
     - `categories_set.png`
     - `publish_clicked.png`
     - `article_live.png`
   - Execution logs with timestamps
   - Final article URL
   - Total execution time

3. **Given** a publish task fails at step 5 (SEO fields)
   **When** the user reviews the task
   **Then** the system shows:
   - Screenshot of the failure state
   - Error message explaining the issue
   - Logs leading up to the failure
   - Retry history (if applicable)

4. **Given** compliance requirements mandate 90-day audit retention
   **When** screenshots and logs are stored
   **Then** all artifacts are:
   - Stored in S3 or local filesystem with 90-day retention policy
   - Accessible via API with task_id
   - Include metadata: timestamp, provider used, user who initiated

**Dependencies**: User Story 3 (requires publishing tasks)

---

### User Story 5 - Provider Performance Comparison & Cost Tracking (Priority: P2)

**As a** system administrator
**I want to** compare performance metrics and costs across different Computer Use providers
**So that** I can optimize for the best balance of reliability, speed, and cost

**Why this priority**: Important for long-term optimization but not blocking initial deployment. Enables data-driven provider selection.

**Independent Test**: Run 50 publish tasks with each provider and verify cost/performance metrics are accurately tracked and queryable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 50 articles published using Anthropic provider
   **And** 50 articles published using Gemini provider
   **And** 50 articles published using Playwright provider
   **When** administrator queries performance metrics API
   **Then** the system returns comparison data:
   - Success rate (% of tasks completed)
   - Average execution time (seconds)
   - Average cost per article (USD)
   - Failure modes breakdown
   - Screenshots per task (quality metric)

2. **Given** cost tracking is enabled
   **When** a Computer Use task completes
   **Then** the estimated cost is calculated and stored:
   - Anthropic: Based on Computer Use API pricing
   - Gemini: Based on Gemini API pricing
   - Playwright: $0.00 (no API cost)
   - Stored in `publish_tasks.cost_usd` field

3. **Given** historical performance data
   **When** administrator views provider comparison dashboard
   **Then** the UI displays:
   - Side-by-side metrics table
   - Cost trend chart over time
   - Recommendations based on usage patterns

**Dependencies**: User Story 3 (requires multiple provider executions)

## Compliance & Governance

This specification adheres to the project's Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

- **I. Modularity**: Provider abstraction enables independent development and testing of each Computer Use implementation
- **II. Observability**: Comprehensive logging, screenshots, and execution logs provide full audit trail
- **III. Security**: Encrypted credential storage, XSS prevention, authentication required
- **IV. Testability**: Each User Story has independent test scenarios, provider switching enables A/B testing
- **V. API-First Design**: All functionality exposed via REST API before UI implementation

### Additional Security Requirements (per Constitution III.5)
- CMS credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Credentials only in Computer Use session memory, never logged
- Minimum privilege WordPress user (Editor role, not Administrator)
- Credential rotation every 90 days
- All CMS login attempts logged to audit_logs table

### Computer Use Testing Strategy (per Constitution IV.5)
- Unit tests use mock Computer Use API
- Integration tests run on isolated test WordPress instances
- Screenshot validation ensures UI elements found
- Quarterly UI regression tests detect WordPress changes
- Fallback to manual publishing if all providers fail

## Appendix: Provider Selection Guide

### When to Use Anthropic Computer Use
- WordPress UI frequently changes
- SEO plugin configuration varies across sites
- Budget allows $1.00-1.50 per article
- Need AI to handle unexpected UI variations

### When to Use Gemini Computer Use
- Cost optimization is critical
- Google ecosystem integration preferred
- Willing to test new/beta API
- Need balance between adaptability and cost

### When to Use Playwright
- High-volume publishing (100+ articles/day)
- WordPress setup is standardized and stable
- Zero API cost requirement
- Development team can maintain selectors
- Speed is critical (need <2 min publish time)

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. **Default**: Playwright (fast, free, reliable)
2. **Fallback**: Anthropic Computer Use (when Playwright fails)
3. **Testing**: Gemini Computer Use (parallel testing for cost comparison)
