# Plan v1.3 – AI-Powered CMS Automation (Phases 0–3)

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Feature ID:** 001-cms-automation  
**Scope:** Phase 0 – Governance | Phase 1 – Setup | Phase 2 – Foundation | Phase 3 – User Story 1 (MVP)

---

## 0. Phase 0 – Governance Compliance Gate

All implementation phases (1–7) must comply with **Constitution v1.0.0**.

**Principle Checklist (Non-Negotiable):**
- ✅ **Modularity** – Each service has clear deployment boundaries and independent testing.  
- ✅ **Observability** – All actions produce structured JSON logs with correlation IDs and health checks.  
- ✅ **Security** – Authentication & RBAC enforced on all API routes; secrets via env variables.  
- ✅ **Testability** – TDD required; ≥ 80 % coverage; E2E tests per user story.  
- ✅ **API-First Design** – OpenAPI contracts defined before implementation.  

**Compliance Gates:**
- CI/CD pipeline must include constitution check (`pytest --maxfail=1 && coverage report --fail-under=80`).  
- Any principle violation requires explicit justification in the Complexity Tracking Table.

## 12. Governance Notes (updated)

The project is now governed under **Constitution v1.0.0 (Ratified 2025-10-25)** which defines five core engineering principles: Modularity, Observability, Security, Testability, and API-First Design.  

- All development phases must pass the **Phase 0 Compliance Gate** before deployment.  
- **Quality Standards:** Performance (5 min p95 generation), Reliability (99.5 % uptime), Architecture (PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker).  
- **Governance Process:** Proposal → Review → Approval → Version Bump → Propagation.  
- Constitution amendments require major version update and peer review approval.

## 13. Next Steps
1. Finalize Phase 3 pending tasks (17 remaining).  
2. Run MVP Verification Checklist (`/checklists/mvp-verification.md`).  
3. Integrate constitution checks into CI/CD pipeline.  
4. Align plan.md and spec.md with Phase 0 governance requirements.  
5. Proceed with Phase 4 – Tagging & Categorization subsystem.
