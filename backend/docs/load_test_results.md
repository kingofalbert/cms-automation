2. Stress test to find actual breaking point
3. Implement monitoring alerts (Prometheus + Grafana)
4. Set up error tracking (Sentry)

**Pre-Deployment (Recommended)**:
1. Security audit and penetration testing
2. Review and rotate API keys
3. Configure production rate limits
4. Set up automated backups
5. Prepare rollback procedures

**Post-Deployment (Monitoring)**:
1. Monitor Claude API costs daily
2. Track SLA compliance in production
3. Set up alerting for degraded performance
4. Regular capacity planning reviews
